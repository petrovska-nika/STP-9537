          <p>
            Yes, Match &amp; Design is completely free to download and play. All
            core features, including puzzle levels and home design tools, are
            accessible without payment. However, we offer optional in-app
            purchases for players who want to enhance their progress or decorate
            faster. These may include additional coins, boosters, or extra
            lives. The game is fully playable and winnable without spending any
            money. We’ve carefully balanced the experience so that free-to-play
            users can enjoy the same challenges and design rewards. You’ll never
            be forced to pay to continue.

            No, Match &amp; Design is playable offline once it is installed on
            your device. This means you can enjoy puzzles and decorate your
            spaces even without a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. However, features
            such as syncing progress, claiming some types of rewards, or
            accessing updates require internet access. Offline play is ideal for
            travel or situations where connectivity is limited. Just remember to
            connect from time to time to back up your progress or download the
            latest content. Internet access also enhances daily bonus tracking
            and leaderboard participation.

            Match &amp; Design follows a classic match-3 puzzle mechanic where
            players swap colored blocks to align three or more in a row. Each
            level has its own unique goal, such as reaching a score, clearing
            obstacles, or collecting specific pieces. As you progress, you’ll
            encounter new block types, obstacles like frozen tiles, and advanced
            combos. Completing puzzle levels earns stars, which you use to
            unlock new design options and tasks. Some levels also introduce
            special items and boosters to help you solve them faster. The
            puzzles are designed to be satisfying yet increasingly strategic as
            the game unfolds.

            In Match &amp; Design, you can decorate a variety of living spaces
            such as bedrooms, kitchens, patios, and entire apartments. Each
            space is broken down into multiple elements—walls, flooring,
            furniture, lighting, and decorative pieces. You choose from several
            style options for each item, giving you full control over the
            interior design. The result is a personalized and visually
            expressive space that reflects your taste. New design zones unlock
            as you progress through puzzle levels. Over time, you’ll have the
            chance to build an entire collection of custom-designed rooms.

            Players earn a range of rewards including coins, boosters, stars,
            and sometimes decorative items for special events. Completing levels
            grants stars, which are used to unlock design tasks. Coins are used
            to purchase extra moves or power-ups during puzzles. Daily logins,
            streaks, and special challenges often provide bonus rewards that
            enhance your experience. Occasionally, limited-time events offer
            exclusive decor styles that you won’t find anywhere else. All
            rewards are designed to support both puzzle progress and your design
            creativity. You can always revisit earlier rooms to use new items
            you’ve unlocked.

          <p>
            Yes, absolutely. Match &amp; Design allows you to revisit any
            previously decorated room and change your selections. If you want to
            try a different couch, wallpaper, or color scheme, simply tap on the
            element and reselect your option. There’s no penalty for changing
            your mind, and no extra cost for reselecting previously unlocked
            items. This flexibility encourages experimentation and creativity
            without stress. It also means you can return to earlier spaces with
            new ideas or decor options that may not have been available before.
            Your home is always evolving—just like your style.

            If you lose a level, you’ll lose one life. Once your lives are
            depleted, you can wait for them to regenerate over time, which
            happens automatically. Alternatively, you can watch an optional ad
            to gain a free life or use in-game currency to refill your lives
            instantly. Some daily bonuses and events also reward lives or life
            refills. Managing your lives strategically can help you tackle
            harder levels more effectively. We aim to balance difficulty and
            accessibility, so players always have a way to continue without
            feeling blocked.

            Currently, Match &amp; Design focuses on a single-player experience,
            but it does include global leaderboards and shared events. You can
            compare your level progression and scores with other players through
            a ranking system. We’re exploring options for future updates that
            may include friend-based challenges or collaborative decorating
            events. For now, players are encouraged to share their room designs
            on social media or take part in community challenges hosted on our
            channels. These allow you to connect creatively without the pressure
            of direct competition. Stay tuned for announcements on future
            multiplayer features.

            Unlike many match-3 titles, Match &amp; Design seamlessly blends
            puzzle solving with creative interior design. You’re not just
            completing levels—you’re building something beautiful and lasting
            with every victory. The design component adds emotional satisfaction
            and visual variety, making progress more rewarding than simply
            clearing stages. The ability to customize entire spaces also gives
            the game a sense of purpose and personality. We’ve also designed the
            gameplay to encourage exploration, with a wide range of puzzle
            mechanics and level types. It’s more than a puzzle—it’s a personal
            expression platform.
